# Note for Wake up and USB port

The system sleep and wake up properly, but has some following issues:

## 1. Can not use external keyboard/mouse and built-in trackpad to wake up from sleep

If you use external keyboard/mouse, you can not wake up your laptop using them (the built-in trackpad can not use to wake up, too). Only the built-in keyboard can wake the system up from sleep.

## 2. External keyboard/mouse can not use if disconnect and reconnect while system is in sleep mode (sometimes)

If you connect your external keyboard/mouse, put your system to sleep, disconnect the external keyboard/mouse and reconnect it again (system still in sleep mode), then wake the system up --> You can not use your external keyboard/mouse after the system wake up. This issue sometimes happen, not always. I don't know why but these are two workaround for this issue:

- If you disconnect and reconnect your external keyboard/mouse while system is in sleep mode and they won't work after wake up, just disconnect and reconnect it when system awake and they will work fine again.
- If you have to disconnect your external keyboard/mouse while system sleep for some reason, make sure to wake the system up before reconnect them, then everything will work fine.
